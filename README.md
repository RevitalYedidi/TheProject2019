# Wireless-Intercom

Wireless building intercom system by web application development, which will be an alternative to intercom systems installed on the doors of the building today and does not need a physical connection for every tenant.
In addition, for existing buildings the way to install the app will be easily possible without any infrastructure changes and high financial cost.

Backend: C# on ASP .NET and SQL

Frontend: HTML, CSS , JavaScript, Bootstrap library


System Installation Instructions:

The app needs to be downloaded and installed on your computer / laptop.
After installation, click the icon to start the system.


The door will be opened by:

- Direct opening through the main pedestal to be installed near the door, from the outside of the building, to occupants with access codes.

- Remote opening through each tenant's account, to which he will connect through his personal device.

- For a guest, who stands near the main pedestal and does not have the access code, there will be an option to send a message through the app to the tenant he wants to reach and if the tenant approves the request the door will be opened remotely.

All door opener data, including time and date and door opener identification information, will be collected into a database to which only the administrator can access, which can export this data to a neat Excel table and draw conclusions and lessons.
